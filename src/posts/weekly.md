Vim command of the week: `/` and general search. `n` and `N` to find next and previous.

## Tinkered & Learned

- aws apigateway: setup simple api
- aws lambda: read documentation, reads a DynamoDB table, increments number, writes to db
- aws CDK: Using TypeScript to script everything in aws. Interesting tool, but seems nascent; not too much support online. The CDK team is responsive on github, though.
