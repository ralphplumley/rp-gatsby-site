# What I'm doing now.

(This is a [nowpage](https://nownownow.com/about), copied from [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now))

## Life

I'm still living in Detroit. Elizabeth and I ~~are expecting around Christmas time :) ~~ just gave birth to a baby girl on December 30th, 2020.

## Career

I'm coding, studying, every day. I have several interviews lined up with big tech companies. I'll need to keep grinding Leetcode. I'll take a couple months off for Parternity, but looking to start a new role around March '21.

I'm also starting taking core CS courses at the local college. I'm completing CS2 and Data Structures this semester.

## Projects

The foreseable future will be videography (for family) and my real state saas app. I'll vlog and document my process. The [InkDrop App developer Takuya](https://blog.inkdrop.info/how-ive-attracted-the-first-500-paid-users-for-my-saas-that-costs-5-mo-7a5b94b8e820) is a big inspiration in aesthetics and product philosophy.
