I've been meaning to keep an online log for a decade or so.
Better late than never.

### Why?

Like [Jeff Atwood says](https://blog.codinghorror.com/about-me/) mostly for selfish reasons.
I believe keeping track of my progress on any projects here will hell elucidate ideas. I'll also post anything
I find interesting, or even notes to myself for later use.
